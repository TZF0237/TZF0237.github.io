> Since the beginning of the century, computational procedures have become so complicated that any progress by those means has become impossible, without the elegance which modern mathematicians have brought to bear on their research, and by means of which the spirit comprehends quickly and in one step a great many computations.
> 
> It is clear that elegance, so vaunted and so aptly named, can have no other purpose. ...
>
> Go to the roots of these calculations! Group the operations. Classify them according to their complexities rather than their appearances! This, I believe, is the mission of future mathematicians. This is the road on which I am embarking in this work.

> If you treat group as a collection of actions, that four notational nightmares axioms are just four common sense properties of such a collection.

#### *The notes also contains some contents from the [MATH40003: Linear Algebra and Groups](/study/Imperial_mathematics/year_1/Linear_Algebra_and_Groups/Linear_Algebra_and_Groups_main) course at Imperial College London.*

#### *For the groups part of the notes, I also learn a lot from the notes written by my friend BrigeCat.*
