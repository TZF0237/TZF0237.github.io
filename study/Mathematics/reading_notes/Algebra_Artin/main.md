##### by Michael Artin

This is a note for the book *Algebra* by Michael Artin. The book is available at [here](https://math.mit.edu/~hrm/palestine/artin-algebra.pdf).

> *Important though the general concepts and propositions may be with which the modern and industrious passion for axiomatizing and generalizing has presented us, in algebra perhaps more than anywhere else, nevertheless I am convinced that the special problems in all their complexity constitute the stock and core of mathematics, and that to master their difficulties requires
on the whole the harder labor.*
