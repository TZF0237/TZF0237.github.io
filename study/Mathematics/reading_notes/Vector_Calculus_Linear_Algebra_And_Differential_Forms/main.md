##### by John H. Hubbard and Barbara Burke Hubbard

 This is a note for the book *Vector Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Differential Forms* by John H. Hubbard and Barbara Burke Hubbard. The book is available at [here](https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hubbard/vectorcalculus.html).

> *... The numerical interpretation ... is however necessary. ... So ... long as it is not obtained, the solutions may be said to remain incomplete and useless, and the truth which it is proposed to discover is no less hidden in the formulae of analysis than it was in the physical problem itself.*
